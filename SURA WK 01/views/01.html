    <h1>Reading 01 - Tips on Creating Stylized 3D Content</h1>
    <h2>
        Techiniques and tools:
    </h2>
    <p>
        - Practiced on Polycount, making personal work and portfolio
    </p>
    <p>
        - Learn through new software packages, new <strong>workflows</strong>, and practice
    </p>
    <p>
        - Low poly art: hardware is less powerful and content designed to be scalable to operate on many platforms
    </p>
    <p> 
        - Low poly thinking: use real- time solution as opposed to renders
    </p>
    <p>
        - Sketchfab for personal work, web-based 3D model viewer which can be accessed on variety of platforms and hardware, but need low poly thinking
    </p>
    <p>
        - Dioramas: iterative process, start off as grey meshes, then chiseled and detailed. Constanting moving, adding, taking away, and make sure there is a consistent level of detail
    </p>
    <p>
        - View at all angles so make sure there are interesting elements 360
    </p>
    <p>
        - All polymodelling done in 3DS Max, only start using other packages like ZBrush if there are organic complex textures
    </p>
    <p>
        - Iterate textures and lighting/mood in tandem to modelling, lay down large areas of colour then work on detailing much later. Larger -> small is important for a balanced piece with the same level of detail across the whole environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        - Tip: having a nice colour palette is imporant and should be decided earlier on
    </p>
    <p>
        - Use squint test to evaluate if the scene is heading in the right direction in development
    </p>
    <p>
        - Composition is hard: keep contrast between horizontal and vertical surfaces, use colours from a small band (unless want it to stand out), separate colour groups to separate buildings, maintain breathing space (especially around objects with high focus)
    </p>
    <p>
        - Scale: real-world scale is irrelevant, but it is important to maintain consistent scale. Keep models of humans dotted around for reference
    </p>
    <p>
        - Keep mesh density and texel density, atlas map textures. Texture alpha is devil for performance
    </p>
    <p>
        - Texturing: isolate small clusters of props in 3DS Max, then projection bake into final atlas UVs
    </p>
    <p>
        - Process: place down flat colour using brush with granular texture, add soft highlight for edges, add softer cavity dirt or occlusion, add extra detais with painterly brush, add adjustment layers to props
    </p>
    <p>
        - Last step is outlining entire scene
    </p>
